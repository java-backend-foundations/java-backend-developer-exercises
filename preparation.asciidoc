- *Apache Maven*: link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Download]
- *JDK 21*:
** For current recommendations, visit: link:https://whichjdk.com/[WhichJDK.com]
** Recommended: Adoptium OpenJDK (*_Eclipse Temurin_*): link:https://adoptium.net/[Download]
** Oracle JDK: link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html[Download]
- *IDE (Choose One)*:

** HTTP client in IntelliJ (Ultimate only)

=== Setup Instructions

. Download and install *Git for Windows* from the provided link.
. Download *Apache Maven* and extract it to a convenient location on your system (e.g. `C:\Programs`). Add the location to the `PATH` environment variable.
. Choose and download *JDK 21* from either the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK options and install it.
. Select and download an *IDE* of your choice (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode) for developing Spring Boot applications.
. Download and install *Postman* for testing your Spring Boot application's RESTful services.
. Create a *Github* account (if you don't have any yet).

Please follow the installation instructions on the download pages for each piece of software.

=== Alternative Installation (Without Admin Rights)

If you don't have administrator privileges on your machine, you can use *Scoop* package manager to install the required software:

==== Installing Scoop

. Open PowerShell (no admin rights required)
. Run the following command to install Scoop:
+
[source,powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
----

==== Installing Software with Scoop

Once Scoop is installed, you can install the required tools:

[source,powershell]
----
# Install Git
scoop install git

# Install Maven
scoop install maven

# Install JDK 21 (Eclipse Temurin)
scoop bucket add java
scoop install temurin21-jdk

# Install additional tools (optional)
scoop install postman

# curl is included with Git, or install separately:
scoop install curl
----

[NOTE]
====
Scoop installs software in your user directory (`%USERPROFILE%\scoop`), so no administrator privileges are required. It automatically manages PATH environment variables.
====

=== Verify Installation

After installation (whether traditional or via Scoop), verify your environment:

- Please open terminal and test the environment. The outputs below may differ from the outputs on your environment.
- Please test the installed JDK version
+
--
[source,bash]
--------
javac -version
--------
--
You should see in the output the same version you have installed, like this
+
--
[source,bash]
--------
javac 21.0.2
--------
--
If you don't see the proper version, check whether your JDK installation is added to the `PATH` environment variable or whether you have set the `JAVA_HOME` variable properly.
- Please test the Maven installation
+
--
[source,bash]
--------
mvn -v
--------
--
You should see the output like this
+
--
[source,bash]
--------
Apache Maven 3.9.5 (57804ffe001d7215b5e7bcb531cf83df38f93546)
